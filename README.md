## Introduction

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Python. It includes explanations, example code, and practical applications for each topic, making it suitable for beginners and advanced learners alike.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ujjwaljha1/dsa-python.git
cd dsa-python
```

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Data Structures

### Arrays

An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together.

### Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object, called a node. Each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

### Stacks

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle. It allows insertion and deletion of elements only at one end, called the top.

### Queues

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle. Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

### Hash Tables

A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots.

### Trees

A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, with a designated node called the root, from which all other nodes branch out.

### Graphs

A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them. Graphs can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted.

### Heaps

A heap is a special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In a max heap, for any given node, the value of the node is greater than or equal to the values of its children, and the highest value is at the root.

### Tries

A trie is a special type of tree used to store associative data structures. A common application of a trie is storing a predictive text or autocomplete dictionary.

## Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are used to rearrange elements in a list or array in a certain order (ascending or descending).

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

### Searching Algorithms

Searching algorithms are designed to retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored.

- Linear Search
- Binary Search

### Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving each of them just once, storing their solutions.

### Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms build up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit.

### Backtracking

Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems.

### Graph Algorithms

Graph algorithms are a set of instructions that traverse (visits nodes of) a graph.

- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm

### String Algorithms

String algorithms deal with problems involving string manipulation and searching within strings.

- Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm
- Rabin-Karp Algorithm
